Output:{"Thought": "This is not a force switch, therefore if I switch in a Pokemon, it will bear a free attack from the opponent. Given shiftry's speed (189) is higher than the opposing steelix (148), shiftry can outspeed steelix. And since FIRE attack deal 2x damage to steelix, I choose to use heatwave, which will lead to a significant damage, even thought it was missed in last turn.", "move":"heatwave"}

Output:{"thought": "Magmortar is faster than Mandibuzz and has a high Special Attack stat, while Mandibuzz has a lower Special Defense. Since Thunderbolt is super-effective against Mandibuzz's Flying type and has 100% accuracy, using Thunderbolt with Magmortar maximizes damage and minimizes risk.

dedenne:Type:ELECTRIC&FAIRY,HP:100%,Atk:107,Def:151,Spa:193,Spd:168,Spe:228,Moves:[thunderbolt,ELECTRIC]

Output:{"thought":"Umbreon is a Dark-type Pokémon weak to Fighting-type moves, and Corviknight has Body Press, a Fighting-type move that uses its high Defense stat for damage calculation. Corviknight's Steel/Flying typing grants it resistance to Dark-type moves and immunity to Poison-type moves like Toxic, minimizing the risk from Umbreon's potential attacks. Switching to another Pokémon like Blaziken or Hitmonlee introduces unnecessary risk, as they could take damage or be affected by status conditions upon entry. Therefore, the best action is to have Corviknight stay in and use Body Press to deal super-effective damage to Umbreon.", "move":"bodypress"}

Example 3:

Historical turns:
Turn 6: opposing Umbreon used Foul Play. It damaged Corviknight's HP by 27% (14% left). Corviknight used Brave Bird. It damaged opposing Umbreon's HP by 31% (4% left). opposing Umbreon outspeeded Corviknight.

dedenne:Type:ELECTRIC&FAIRY,HP:100%,Atk:107,Def:151,Spa:193,Spd:168,Spe:228,Moves:[thunderbolt,ELECTRIC]


Output: {"thought": "Since Corviknight is at 10% HP and will be knocked out by Umbreon's next Foul Play due to being outsped, and switching to Dedenne would result in it taking unnecessary damage from that attack, it's more strategic to let Corviknight faint. Preserving Corviknight at such low health may not offer significant advantages in future turns, and avoiding damage to Dedenne keeps it at full strength for later battles. Therefore, the best action is to keep Corviknight in and accept that it will be knocked out.", "move":"bravebird"}


Example 3:
Historical turns:
Turn 4: opposing Archeops used Stone Edge. It was ineffective to Flygon. A critical hit. It damaged Flygon's HP by 68% (32% left). Flygon used Outrage. It damaged opposing Archeops's HP by 70% (30% left). opposing Archeops outspeeded Flygon.
Turn 5: (Current turn):
Opponent has 5 pokemons left.
Opponent current pokemon:archeops:Type:ROCK&FLYING,HP:30%,Atk:280,Def:156,Spa:234,Spd:156,Spe:230
You have 4 pokemons can switch:
lunatone:Type:ROCK&PSYCHIC,HP:100%,Atk:101,Def:165,Spa:217,Spd:200,Spe:173,Moves:[earthpower,GROUND],[powergem,ROCK],[psychic,PSYCHIC]

maractus:Type:GRASS,HP:100%,Atk:170,Def:183,Spa:258,Spd:183,Spe:170,Moves:[energyball,GRASS]

Lunatone is a solid choice because it can withstand Archeops's attacks thanks to its good defenses and neutral typing against Rock-type moves. Moreover, Lunatone can retaliate with Power Gem, a super-effective Rock-type move against Archeops's Rock/Flying typing, likely securing a knockout. Therefore, the best action is to switch to Lunatone to safely eliminate Archeops.
