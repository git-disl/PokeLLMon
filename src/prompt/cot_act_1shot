Your current pokemon:shiftry,Type:GRASS&DARK,HP:41%,Atk:179,Def:154,Spa:206,Spd:154,Spe:189
Your shiftry has 4 moves can take:
nastyplot:Type:DARK,Cate:Status,Power:0,Acc:100%,Effect:Raises the user's Special Attack by two stages.
darkpulse:Type:DARK,Cate:Special,Power:105,Acc:100%,Effect:Has a 20% chance to make the target flinch.

You have 5 pokemons can switch:
garbodor:Type:POISON,HP:100%,Atk:215,Def:192,Spa:154,Spd:192,Spe:180,Moves:[stompingtantrum,GROUND],[gunkshot,POISON]
cobalion:Type:STEEL&FIGHTING,HP:100%,Atk:185,Def:246,Spa:185,Spd:157,Spe:214,Moves:[closecombat,FIGHTING],[ironhead,STEEL],[stoneedge,ROCK]

Output:{"Thought": "This is not a force switch, therefore if I switch in a Pokemon, it will bear a free attack from the opponent. Given shiftry's speed (189) is higher than the opposing steelix (148), shiftry can outspeed steelix. And since FIRE attack deal 2x damage to steelix, I choose to use heatwave, which will lead to a significant damage, even thought it was missed in last turn.", "move":"heatwave"}
