Output:{"thought": "Although slower, Druddigon is not vulnerable to the opposing Necrozma's PSYCHIC attack, thus can bear attacks from the opponent. At the beggining of the game (turn 1), setting steal rock to opponent's team is a good choice because it can cause damage when opposing pokemon switch in.", "move":"stealthrock"}
