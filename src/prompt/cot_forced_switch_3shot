vanilluxe:Type:ICE,HP:100%,Atk:203,Def:187,Spa:228,Spd:203,Spe:177,Moves:[blizzard,ICE],[explosion,NORMAL],[freezedry,ICE]


thought: Golduck is a strong choice because it has a higher speed stat (195) compared to Heatran (165), allowing it to move first. Additionally, Golduck's Water typing resists Fire-type moves and its move Scald is super effective against Heatran's Fire/Steel typing. Therefore, the best action is to switch to Golduck to prepare for a super-effective attack.
