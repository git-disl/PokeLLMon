Proposal:
{"thought":"Thievul's previous Dark Pulse did 78% damage, leaving Dragalge at 22% HP. Since Thievul outspeeds Dragalge, it will KO Dragalge before it can attack. Switching out Dragalge keeps it as fodder or for a potential safe switch-in later. If choose to switch, the switch in pokemon will first bear an attack. With a high SpD, Snorlax can potentially survive a boosted Dark Pulse from Thievul. If Thievul misses, we can use focusblast to knock out Thievul.", "proposal1":{"switch":"snorlax"}, "proposal2":{"move":"focusblast"}, "proposal3":{"move":"dracometeor"}}
Output:{"thought": "Since Thievul outspeeds Dragalge and has high Spa, it will KO Dragalge before it can attack. If choose to use attack, it is very likely be knocked out in the next step. However, if choose to switch in a non force switch, the switch in pokemon will first bear an attack and be knocked out since Thievul's Special Attack has been boosted very high. Therefore, it is better to let Thievul stay in the battle to be knocked out and switch in a faster pokemon in a force switch.","move":"focusblast"}
